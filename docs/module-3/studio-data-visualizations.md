One of the benefits of structured data is that it can be re-arranged, changed, and presented in different ways. For many use cases a visual representation of product data can cut down the time it takes to analyze and understand your product. SPREAD Studio offers a number of ways to visualize data in the custom applications that you can create.

The more popular visualizations widgets are listed below, along with links to documentation about their properties.
