One of the benefits of structured data is that it can be rearranged, changed, and presented in different ways. For many use cases a visual representation of product data can cut down the time it takes to analyze and understand your product. SPREAD Studio offers a number of ways to visualize data in the custom applications that you can create. The more popular visualizations widgets (and their accessories) are introduced below.
