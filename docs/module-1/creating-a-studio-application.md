To display data, we will be working in SPREAD Studio - which is a tool to create applications that build on your product knowledge. From the SPREAD Platform Launcher page, select the **Studio** tile. You can also use the [direct link](https://studio.{{ snippets.tenantURL }}) for your SPREAD instance.
